title:  The Adventure Begins

Today marks the first day of August, and more exitingly the first real day of living in my truck. I have slept in the back before to "test drive" how it was going to work out. Last night was my first night without an apartment, but since I stayed in the comfort of my friends driveway, I'm not considering it part of this grand experiment. 

Tonight I am staying on a street by my buddy's parents house. We were working on our boat we purchased together, and plan to continue in the morning. He boasted about the safety of this neighborhood, so in light of that and the convenience factor, this will be home tonight. 

I am still dealing with the fallout from moving so I still have items cluttering the truck bed, one of which was a bag of trash which had torn open leaving me to deal with the cleanup before I could climb into bed. Next step was to cover the windows. My girlfriend was gracious enough to take time out of her busy schedule to make me a nice set of curtains, but since I haven't come up with a solution to hang them, I had to come up with something else for tonight. For one of the long windows I used foam that will be used for the bed. For the other long window I used a fitted sheet and tucked it into the screen. The only other window I cover was the back window over the tailgate. For that I just hung a towel from the hinges. 

As I sit here and write this I realize just how noisy most places are but we rarely notice it. Across the street a young child is telling a story to what I presume is his mother. I hear cars passing in the distance and garage doors opening and closing. It has only been about 30 minutes since I hopped back here and 4 folks have already walked by. I think it will be a bit more difficult falling asleep here compared with in the percieved safety of my friends driveway.
