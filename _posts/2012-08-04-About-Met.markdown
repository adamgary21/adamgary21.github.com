title: About Me

<img src="/me.jpeg" alt="me" style="width:150px;" />
I fell in love with computers and well, all electronics at a very young age. 
When I was just 10 years old, I played Jazz the Jackrabbit on an old Windows 
95 machine. Since the game was launched from a DOS prompt, I was
exposed to a terminal to the first time. Since then my passion for computers,
fueled by curiousity, has lead me to explore many areas in computing and earn 
a Applied Networking and Systems Administration degree from the Rochester 
Institute of Technology (RIT). I have held many different computer related positions 
from running my own computer repair business to a Network Engineer at Xerox 
to a NOC engineer at LinkedIn. It was always my dream to work for Cisco 
Systems in High School. After completing an internship with them, I set my 
goals even higher, yet I hadn't defined what that "higher" was yet. My senior 
year at RIT, I was contacted by LinkedIn, and ultimately offered a position 
as a NOC engineer at their headquarters in Mountain View California. A tech 
guy offered a position in Silicon Valley? What a no-brainer! Since then it 
has been nothing short of a dream. I am eager to see where I take myself in 
the years to come.
